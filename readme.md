There is likely multiple libraries to do this same thing, I did this mostly for fun, and since I need to customize sorting to certain output type

```JS
{
  group: "Kumpula",
  items: [
    [
      {
        group: "sports",
        items: [
          {
              "......":"....."
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

## Example using https://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/

## How to use
1. Make the sortable data available in single level (Node.JS array.map() is handy for this
2. Decide grouping criteria
